# CASTS (ACADEMIC, NOT FOR RESALE)
CASTS is a platform independent JAVA program that downloads and runs a collection of Automated Testing Software. 
The Included Software is EvoSuite, Emma, and ÂµJava. 

The program executes on CLI via:
    java -jar CASTS.jar


CASTS will download the necessary files and execute them on the specified program.

The user is asked for the absolute path to the classpath or bin directories.

upon EvoSuite completion the user is asked for the absolute path to the .jar file

a new CLI is spawned for user interaction with their program and EMMA Code Coverage reports are exported to the desktop
